This is the final project of EECS151LA: ASIC Lab, where I participated as a visiting student in the spring semester of 2024. The goal is to design a 3-stage pipeline RISCV CPU processor.
The project is divided into 4 checkpoints and a final checkoff. For details, please see [this](https://github.com/EECS150/asic-project-sp24/blob/main/overview.md).

Checkpoints solution and our design details can be found in my [blog](https://skylanding.github.io/2024/03/21/EECS151-Project/).
